    "In this session we will be learning the ins and outs of one of the key pieces in spatial analysis: spatial weights matrices. These are structured sets of numbers that formalize geographical relationships between the observations in a dataset. Essentially, a spatial weights matrix of a given geography is a matrix of dimensions $N$ by $N$, where $N$ is the total number of observations:\n",

    "\\vdots & w_{ji} & 0 & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "w_{N1} & \\dots & \\dots & 0 \n",
    "\\end{array} \\right)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each cell $w_{ij}$ contains a value that represents the degree of spatial contact or interaction between observations $i$ and $j$. A fundamental concept in this context is that of *neighbor* and *neighborhood*. By convention, elements in the diagonal ($w_{ii}$) are set to zero. A *neighbor* of a given observation $i$ is another observation with which $i$ has some degree of connection. In terms of $W$, $i$ and $j$ are thus neighbors if $w_{ij} > 0$. Following this logic, the neighborhood of $i$ will be the set of observations in the system with which it has a connection, or those observations with a weight greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create such matrices, and many more to transform them so they contain an accurate representation that aligns with the way we understand spatial interactions between the elements of a system.

    "Following this logic of more detailed weights through distance, there is a temptation to take it further and consider everyone else in the dataset as a neighbor whose weight will then get modulated by the distance effect shown above. However, although conceptually correct, this approach is not always the most computationally or practical one. Because of the nature of spatial weights matrices, particularly because of the fact their size is $N$ by $N$, they can grow substantially large. A way to cope with this problem is by making sure they remain fairly *sparse* (with many zeros). Sparsity is typically ensured in the case of contiguity or KNN by construction but, with inverse distance, it needs to be imposed as, otherwise, the matrix could be potentially entirely dense (no zero values other than the diagonal). In practical terms, what is usually done is to impose a distance threshold beyond which no weight is assigned and interaction is assumed to be non-existent. Beyond being computationally feasible and scalable, results from this approach usually do not differ much from a fully \"dense\" one as the additional information that is included from further observations is almost ignored due to the small weight they receive. In this context, a commonly used threshold, although not always best, is that which makes every observation to have at least one neighbor. \n",
