    "## Introduction to GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas - the spatial extension of pandas - is one of the core libraries for doing geospatial analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various different GIS data formats available such as [GPKG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language), and [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/io.html) is capable of reading data from all of these formats (plus many more) and combines the capabilities of the data analysis library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) with other packages like [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) and [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) for managing spatial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures in geopandas are `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` which extend the capabilities of `Series` and `DataFrames` from pandas. This means that we can use all our pandas skills also when working with geopandas - with some added spatial functionalities üåê\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between geodataframes and pandas dataframes is that a [geodataframe](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/data_structures.html#geodataframe) should contain one column for **geometries**. By default, the name of this column is `'geometry'`. The geometry column is a [geoseries](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/data_structures.html#geoseries) which contains the geometries (points, lines, polygons, multipolygons etc.) as shapely objects.
