    "## Task I: NYC Geodemographics\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to try to get at the (geographic) essence of New York City. For that, we will rely on a data set of the census tracts for New York City we used for exercise 4 (from the [PySAL examples](https://pysal.org/libpysal/tutorial.html?highlight=examples#example-datasets)). Once you have the `nyc` object loaded, create a geodemographic classification using the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `european`: Population White\n",
    "- `asian`: Population Asian American\n",
    "- `american`: Population American Indian\n",
    "- `african`: Population African American\n",
    "- `hispanic`: Population Hispanic\n",
    "- `mixed`: Population Mixed race\n",
    "- `pacific`: Population Pacific Islander\n",
    "- `otherethni`: Population of other ethnicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the clustering, make sure to standardize these variables (by using percentages instead of absolute numbers). NB: Compute the total population for each tract yourself (do *not* use the \"poptot\" column from the data set as this will lead to discrepancies.) The resulting values should range from 0 (no population of a given ethnic group in that tract) to 1 (all population of that tract is in the given ethnic group). Once this is ready, get to work with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a number of clusters, N\n",
    "1. Run K-Means for N clusters\n",
    "1. Plot the different clusters on a map\n",
    "1. Analyse the results, using for example bar plots, the KDE-plots from the lectures, etc.:\n",
    "    - *What do you find?*\n",
    "    - *What are the main characteristics of each cluster?*\n",
    "    - *How are clusters distributed geographically?*\n",
    "    - *Can you identify some groups concentrated on particular areas (e.g. China Town, Little Italy)?*\n",
    "1. Redo with a different N; how do results depend on the number of chosen clusters?"
